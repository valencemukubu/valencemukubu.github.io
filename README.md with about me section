# About Me
- I was born and raised in Miami flordia. My family is from the Democratic Republic Of Congo so I am afircan american. I recently moved down to north carolina in the beginning of 2024 to go to school at wake tech. On my free time i like to make beats, workout, read books, watch movies, and play video games.  
## Websites I Recommend
- [Musical Artifacts](https://musical-artifacts.com/) - I find Musicsal artifacts very resourceful
for researching all kinds of different sounds and instruments used in music production.
- [Sounds Resource](https://www.sounds-resource.com/) - Just like in my previous link, The " Sound Resource " is another resourceful website used to obtain sounds and instruments used specifically in video games that you can add into music your production.
